It provides a high-performance API layer that supports multi-user account management, video streaming, secure authentication, and payment integrations — all optimized for scalability.

### 🚀 Key Features

#### 🎥 Video Streaming Engine
Stream movies and TV shows seamlessly with adaptive performance and efficient file delivery.
ImageKit integration ensures optimized thumbnails, video previews, and on-the-fly image transformations.

#### 👥 Multi-User Account System
Users can share a single account with multiple profiles — each maintaining independent watch history, favorites, and preferences.

#### 🔐 Advanced Authentication & Security
Powered by JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless sessions and bcrypt for encrypted password storage.
Helmet and Express Rate Limit add extra layers of API security, preventing brute-force and DDoS attacks.

#### 💳 Stripe & PayPal Integration
Dual payment gateway support for flexible subscriptions and transactions.
Every payment is securely stored, tracked, and verified through a dedicated payments module.

#### 🧩 Data Modeling & Aggregation Pipelines
Built using Mongoose, each entity (User, Video, Subscription, Payment, Watch History) is modeled for clarity and scalability.
Aggregation pipelines are used for insights — like most-watched genres, top creators, and revenue analytics.

#### 🌐 Cross-Origin Ready (CORS)
Configured with fine-grained rules to allow controlled access from trusted frontend clients.

#### 👛 Environment-based Configuration
With dotenv, all environment secrets (API keys, DB URIs, tokens) are securely managed and never hard-coded.
